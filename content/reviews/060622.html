    <p>&#09;Ever since I found Toro Y Moi I've been waiting for a new album, but whether I'll like it or not always depends on what direction it'll go. Chaz Bear, the person behind the project, has always changed styles with every new release. This time around, he returns to a lot of the psych-rock and funk sounds that were on 2015's "What For?"<br /><br />I must say that I do enjoy this album a lot, but not as much as the somewhat more experimental sounds I've heard from, for instance, 2019's "Outer Peace."<br />Regardless, I now own it as a CD, and I don't regret it at all. Favorite tracks include "Millennium" and "Postman," and in addition to that the drum fills on the outro track, "Days in Love" are absolutely great.</p>
